      "The Boxer descends from two types of German Bullenbeisers, or bull-biters.",
      "The Bullenbeisers were originally used to chase large game, such as boar, deer, and bear, through the forests, grabbing and hanging on until the hunter could arrive to dispatch it.",
      "In the early 1800s, German hunters tried to improve their hunting dogs by crossing their Bullenbeisers with mastiff-type dogs and with Bulldogs.",
      "By the late 1800s, these dogs were popular as butcher's dogs, controlling cattle in slaughter yards.",
      "The slaughter yard dogs were called Boxl, which may have been the origin of the name, Boxer.",
      "The Boxer was established by 1895.",
      "The Boxer was one of the first breeds used as a police and military dog.",
      "In 1904, the AKC recognized the Boxer.",
